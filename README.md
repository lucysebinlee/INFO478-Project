Data: Student Alcohol Consumption Dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption

## Project Description
1. What is the purpose of your research project?
> The purpose of this research project is to explore the effects of alcohol consumption over student's performance. We will be providing basic summary statistics of gender, parentâ€™s educations and jobs, with alcohol consumption. Moreover, we will be comparing the rates of alcohol consumption with the absence of school, grades, and number of class failures. 

2. What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works.
> Students Alcohol Consumption Data Analysis: https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/365904_90b5ff49711448b5aa6ba2f09ffb4fc3.html
This study analyze the alcohol consumption of students and correlate with student academic performance. They used parent's education levels, gender, alcohol consumption rates based on grade levels, and number of class failures, to investigate the data.

> Using Data Mining To Predict Secondary School Student Performance: http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf
This study highlights on the importance of education, and addressed the predictions of secondary student grades by using various of school-related data. This data is valuable in finding data to improve the quality of education and enhance management of school resource.

> Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study, 2001 https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/HMCA/studies/4291 
This is a survey based on the interviews of students in four-year colleges, examined key issues in alcohol abuse and other high risk behaviors among college students. Also including the relationship of state alcohol control measures and college policies to alcohol use and the role of fraternities and sororities, how easy access to alcohol, and the alcohol prices.


3. What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.
> The data we will working on is Student Alcohol consumption that we found from Kaggle. The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. The data from the students belong to two schools of Portugal - Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira.

4. Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.
> The target audience would be university students in Portugal. This will help them understand the possible effects that alcohol consumption can have on the many aspects of their lives. 
>
> Another target audience that could be used for this project is educators. This analysis could possibly be used to help guide these educators on how to help their students in the best way possible. We are planning on using University students, but would like some feedback if this will be a better direction to go in.

5. What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)
> For University students, this project will help them understand the possible effects that alcohol consumption can have on the many aspects of their lives. 
>
> For educators, this analysis could possibly be used to help guide these educators on how to help their students in the best way possible. 

## Technical Description
1. What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?
> Our final product will be created using Shiny app.

2. Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?
> There are many different variables to search through to try and come up with meaningful trends and relationships.

3. What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?
> We need to learn more about processing large datasets in order to complete the project. E.x. Cleaning and interpreting the data.

4. What major challenges do you anticipate? 
> We expect it to be difficult to find strong relationships between variables from our data collection. Variables can be associated with each other but not necessarily be strongly correlated. From there, we have to figure out the best way to convey this information, such as in the type of visualization.
